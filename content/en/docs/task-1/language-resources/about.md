So basically my goal is to build a place where you can find all relevant language in IELTS Writing. Different from the lists of structures above, here I simply store a whole bunch of words, phrases, or structures, with appropriate key words to make searching more efficient.

If you type "increase", for example, you'll find the specific language to help you describe that feature.

I hope you'll find this useful. ðŸ˜™
