	- to provide protection (e.g. army, police)
	- to build insfrastructure (e.g. roads, power supplies)
	- to make technological progress
	- to change people's behavior (e.g. putting high taxes on tobacco to reduce smoking)
	- to support the disadvantaged (e.g. the poor, the disabled)
- Governments also raise or lower taxes to help their country's economy.
