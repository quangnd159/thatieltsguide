There are a number of things that parents can do to help their children behave in school. One is to make sure that the child is getting enough sleep and is well-rested. Another is to make sure that the child has a nutritious breakfast before school. A third is to help the child find ways to **cope with stress and anxiety**. Finally, it is important to talk to the child's teachers and school administrators to **get a sense of what is going on** at school and to make sure that the child is getting the support he or she needs.

There are a number of reasons why teachers should be responsible for disciplining students. First, teachers are the adults in the room and are responsible for creating **a safe and respectful learning environment**. Second, teachers have a much better understanding of the individual students in their class and what behaviour is likely to be **disruptive** or disrespectful. Finally, teachers are the professionals who **are trained in how to effectively manage student behaviour**.

There are a number of reasons why teachers should be responsible for disciplining students. First, teachers are the ones who are typically in the classroom with the students and **are** therefore **in the best position to** see and understand what is happening. Second, teachers have a better understanding than anyone else of what the expectations are for students **in terms of** behavior and how to **maintain order** in the classroom. Finally, teachers are the ones who are **ultimately** responsible for the safety and well-being of their students, and they need to be able to take action if there are problems.

I believe that both teachers and parents **share responsibility for fostering discipline** in schools. Teachers play a role in setting expectations for student behavior and providing consequences when those expectations are not met. Parents also play a role in **modeling appropriate behavior** for their children and **reinforcing** school **rules** at home. Ultimately, it takes a team effort from both parents and teachers to ensure that students are disciplined and behaving appropriately in school.
