There are a number of things that parents can do to help their children behave in school. One is to make sure that the child is getting enough sleep and is well-rested. Another is to make sure that the child has a nutritious breakfast before school. A third is to help the child find ways to <mark>cope with stress and anxiety</mark>. Finally, it is important to talk to the child's teachers and school administrators to <mark>get a sense of what is going on</mark> at school and to make sure that the child is getting the support he or she needs.

There are a number of reasons why teachers should be responsible for disciplining students. First, teachers are the adults in the room and are responsible for creating <mark>a safe and respectful learning environment</mark>. Second, teachers have a much better understanding of the individual students in their class and what behaviour is likely to be <mark>disruptive</mark> or disrespectful. Finally, teachers are the professionals who <mark>are trained in how to effectively manage student behaviour</mark>.

There are a number of reasons why teachers should be responsible for disciplining students. First, teachers are the ones who are typically in the classroom with the students and <mark>are</mark> therefore <mark>in the best position to</mark> see and understand what is happening. Second, teachers have a better understanding than anyone else of what the expectations are for students <mark>in terms of</mark> behavior and how to <mark>maintain order</mark> in the classroom. Finally, teachers are the ones who are <mark>ultimately</mark> responsible for the safety and well-being of their students, and they need to be able to take action if there are problems.

I believe that both teachers and parents <mark>share responsibility for fostering discipline</mark> in schools. Teachers play a role in setting expectations for student behavior and providing consequences when those expectations are not met. Parents also play a role in <mark>modeling appropriate behavior</mark> for their children and <mark>reinforcing</mark> school <mark>rules</mark> at home. Ultimately, it takes a team effort from both parents and teachers to ensure that students are disciplined and behaving appropriately in school.
