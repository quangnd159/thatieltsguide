No AI will help us write essays in the actual exam, but it can be helpful when it comes to ideas and language usage. Here you'll find AI-generated content for different IELTS topics, and I must say, the language is pretty darn good! üò≥ This, in combination with [daily Anki reviews](https://dangquang.xyz/p/srs/), will likely result in a huge boost in your essay writing skills.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that not every idea is directly relevant to the task. Ultimately, you must learn to select ideas that best fit the topic you're dealing with.

Below is some sample content. You can search using `ai` and a keyword to find more e.g. `ai family` or `ai environment`.

## Art

Some people think that the government is [wasting money on the arts](ai-gen/wasting-money-on-arts.md) and that this money could be better spent elsewhere. To what extent do you agree with this view?

How can these problems be solved?

## Education

Discipline is an ever increasing problem in modern schools. Some people think that [discipline should be the responsibility of teachers](ai-gen/student-discipline-parents-teachers.md), while others think that this is the role of parents. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.

## Enrivonment

Both governments and individuals are [spending vast amounts of money protecting animals and their habitat](ai-gen/protecting-animals-or-humans.md). This money could be better spent dealing with fundamental issues in society such as poverty and health care. To what extent do you agree?

## People

[It is important for people to take risks](ai-gen/taking-risks.md), both in their professional lives and their personal lives. Do you think the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages?

In some countries, [many more people are choosing to live alone](ai-gen/living-alone.md) than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?
