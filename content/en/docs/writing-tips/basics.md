### Avoid informal language

Do not use informal words and expressions like _a lot of / lots of_, _a big fan of_, _kid_, _dad_, _mom_, _stuff_, _cool_ etc.

### Leave a blank line between paragraph

This helps the examiner in reading your essay.

### Avoid cliché

Do not use _in a nutshell_, _first and foremost_, _last but not least_ etc. These are cliché.

### Do not use contraction

Do not use contraction such as _won't_ and _can't_. Write _will not_ and _cannot_.

### Do not use "you"

Avoid using ~~you~~; instead, use third-person words like _people_ and (when relevant) _young/old people, teenagers, workers, students, the public_ etc.
