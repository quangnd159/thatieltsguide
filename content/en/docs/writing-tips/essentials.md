### Write simply

Good writing is clear writing. Do not use big words to impress. Do not try to write long sentences. Instead, try to explain your ideas as clearly as you can.

### Be careful with big words

Big words tend to need very specific contexts (e.g. _harmful_ vs. _pernicious_). They also often require appropriate styles and collocations. Generally, shorter words tend to be more natural.

### Word repetition is fine

It's fine, folks. Calm down. Don't try to change the word "children" every time you need to use it in an essay. Children are children. They are not necessarily _minor_, or _junior_, or _kids_, or _juveniles_.

### Avoid informal language

Do not use informal words and expressions like _a lot of / lots of_, _a big fan of_, _kid_, _dad_, _mom_, _stuff_, _cool_ etc.

### Leave a blank line between paragraph

This helps the examiner in reading your essay.

### Avoid cliché

Do not use _in a nutshell_, _first and foremost_, _last but not least_ etc. These are cliché.

### Do not use contraction

Do not use contraction such as _won't_ and _can't_. Write _will not_ and _cannot_.

### Do not use "you"

Avoid using ~~you~~; instead, use third-person words like _people_ and (when relevant) _young/old people, teenagers, workers, students, the public_ etc.
