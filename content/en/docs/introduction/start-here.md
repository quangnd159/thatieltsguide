You can play with the menu to see if there’s anything cool. On mobile, tap on the two arrows to see the menu. You can also use 🔎 `Search` to find what you need and I hope it will pop up.

The point of this guide is to aid you in your practice. Gradually, though, it should be transferred into your head and transformed into skills. My hope is that one day you won't need this guide any more.

IELTS needn’t be hard. With practice and patience, you’ll nail it. Good luck! 🍀
